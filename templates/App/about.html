		<h1 style="color:DeepSkyBlue;">About : </h1>
    <h3 style="color:FloralWhite;">This is a basic machine learning and deep learning based medical app.</h3>
    <p style="color:FloralWhite;">The prediction about the disease is made with the help of the machine learning and deep learning model which itself is trained on the thousands of the datasets</p>
    <p style="color:FloralWhite;">So with the following paragraph I gonna be describing about the types of the diseases which gonna be getting employed in this app.</p>
    <h2 style="color:SkyBlue;">1. Diabetes</h2>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px">
       <img style="max-width: 450px" src="media/diab.jpg"/>
   </div>
<p style="color:FloralWhite;">Diabetes is a disease that occurs when your blood glucose, also called blood sugar, is too high. Blood glucose is your main source of energy and comes from the food you eat. Insulin, a hormone made by the pancreas, helps glucose from food get into your cells to be used for energy.</p>
<h3 style="color:FloralWhite;">What health problems can people with diabetes develop? </h3>
<p style="color:FloralWhite;">Over time, high blood glucose leads to problems such as</p>

 <ul>
  <li style="color:FloralWhite;">Heart Disease</li>
  <li style="color:FloralWhite;">Stroke</li>
  <li style="color:FloralWhite;">Kidney Disease</li>
  <li style="color:FloralWhite;">Eye Problems</li>
  <li style="color:FloralWhite;">Dental disease</li>
  <li style="color:FloralWhite;">Nerve Damage</li>
</ul>
<br>


        <h2 style="color:SkyBlue;">2. Malaria</h2>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px">
       <img style="max-width: 450px" src="media/mal.jpg"/>
   </div>
<p style="color:FloralWhite;">Malaria is a life-threatening mosquito-borne blood disease. The Anopheles mosquito transmits it to humans.</p>
<p style="color:FloralWhite;">The parasites in mosquitos that spread malaria belong to the Plasmodium genus. Over 100 types of Plasmodium parasite can infect a variety of species. Different types replicate at different rates, changing how quickly the symptoms escalate, and the severity of the disease. </p>

<h3 style="color:FloralWhite;">Symptoms</h3>
<ul>
    <li style="color:FloralWhite;">Fever and chills</li>
    <li style="color:FloralWhite;">Impaired consciousness</li>
    <li style="color:FloralWhite;">Prostration, or adopting a prone position
    multiple convulsions</li>
    <li style="color:FloralWhite;">Deep breathing and respiratory distress</li>
    <li style="color:FloralWhite;">Abnormal bleeding and signs of anemia</li>
    <li style="color:FloralWhite;">Clinical jaundice and evidence of vital organ dysfunction</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
<h2 style="color:SkyBlue;">3.Heart Disease</h2>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px">
       <img style="max-width: 450px" src="media/heart.jpg"/>
   </div>
<p style="color:FloralWhite;text-align:justify;">Heart disease describes a range of conditions that affect your heart. Diseases under the heart disease umbrella include blood vessel diseases, such as coronary artery disease; heart rhythm problems (arrhythmias); and heart defects you're born with (congenital heart defects), among others.<br>
  The term "heart disease" is often used interchangeably with the term "cardiovascular disease." Cardiovascular disease generally refers to conditions that involve narrowed or blocked blood vessels that can lead to a heart attack, chest pain (angina) or stroke. Other heart conditions, such as those that affect your heart's muscle, valves or rhythm, also are considered forms of heart disease.<br></p>

<h3 style="color:FloralWhite;">Symptoms</h3>
 <ul>
  <li style="color:FloralWhite;">Chest pain, chest tightness, chest pressure and chest discomfort (angina)</li>
  <li style="color:FloralWhite;">Shortness of breath</li>
  <li style="color:FloralWhite;">Pain, numbness, weakness or coldness in your legs or arms if the blood vessels in those parts of your body are narrowed</li>
  <li style="color:FloralWhite;">Pain in the neck, jaw, throat, upper abdomen or back</li>
</ul>
<br>
    <h2 style="color:SkyBlue;">4. COVID19 Detection From Lungs X-Ray</h2>
<div style="text-align: center; margin-top: 20px">
       <img style="max-width: 450px" src="media/76065360.cms"/>
   </div>
<p style="color:FloralWhite;text-align:justify;">In pneumonia, the lungs become filled with fluid and inflamed, leading to breathing difficulties. For some people, breathing problems can become severe enough to require treatment at the hospital with oxygen or even a ventilator.<br>
  The pneumonia that COVID-19 causes tends to take hold in both lungs. Air sacs in the lungs fill with fluid, limiting their ability to take in oxygen and causing shortness of breath, cough and other symptoms.<br></p>

<h3 style="color:FloralWhite;">Symptoms</h3>
 <ul>
  <li style="color:FloralWhite;">Difficulty breathing or shortness of Breath</li>
  <li style="color:FloralWhite;">Chest pain or pressure</li>
  <li style="color:FloralWhite;">Loss of speech or movement</li>
  <li style="color:FloralWhite;">Fever, Dry Cough, Tiredness</li>
</ul>
